## sethammons.com

This is the hugo project running sethammons.com. It is an excuse to try some docker things and play with Hugo.

If you have docker and fig, you can simply:
`sudo fig build; sudo fig stop; sudo fig up -d`

There is currently a hardcoded value that sets the url my my domain. If you want to do local development, you'll want to change sethammons.com to localhost.
