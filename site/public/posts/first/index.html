    <h3 id="now-on-hugo">Now on Hugo</h3>
<p>I've been looking lately to move off my shared hosting (I know, right?) and I have been seeking an excuse to move all my stuff over to Digital Ocean. I've finally gotten off the pot, and decided that I would expore Docker using Digital Ocean as the backing hardware.</p>
<p>Previously, I had a homegrown site. As I don't spend my freetime making hot designs anymore, that site quickly fell out of anything resembling something polished. I switched over to the first blog-like management utility I could quickly set up on the shared hosting. It could not handle code snippets and that limited my drive to keep posting. Being so busy, I just let it slide.</p>
<p>Fast foward to today, and I finally decided it was time to get my web-presence back up-to-snuff. Knowing that I was to play with Docker and Digital Ocean, coupled with knowing that I wanted something easily able to write small posts about and show code snippits (and the fact that I am thuroughly enjoying Go), it seemed like Hugo was a great choice.</p>
<p>So, here it is. My first post in Hugo.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="color:#f92672">package</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">main</span>

<span style="color:#f92672">import</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;log&#34;</span>

<span style="color:#66d9ef">func</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">main</span>(){
        <span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">Println</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Digital Ocean + Docker + Hugo = Posting Again&#34;</span>)
}</code></pre></div>
