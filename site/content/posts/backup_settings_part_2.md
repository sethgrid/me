### Settings Backup, Part 2

Somehow my laptop screen got a crack in it. Totally suxorz. I have… er… had a System76 Serval Professional. Awesome machine. While that rig is being sent out for repairs, I’ve installed Ubuntu on a spare laptop and pulled in my Github repo with my settings backup. Presto, chango — my terminal in all its bashy goodness is back to the exact way I like it. Couple that with a Dropbox full of standard background images set up with Wallch and it is like I never changed computers.
