Working through some Perl code today (shudder). I came across the slash slash equals operator, two forwards slashes and an equals sign `//=`. No, it is not a comment. It is very similar to pipe pipe equals `||=`, but is restricted to undef values. Google needs to work on a way to better search for programming operators.
