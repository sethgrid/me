      <description>So, a few minutes ago, I was all excited on how easy Hugo was to get started. While I really like what I am seeing in a lot of ways, what I do not like is the documentation for syntax highlighting.
From the configuration page:
# color-codes for highlighting derived from this style pygmentsStyle: &amp;quot;monokai&amp;quot; # true: use pygments-css or false: color-codes directly pygmentsUseClasses: false  Using this, coupled with the syntax highlighting page, I cannot get sytanx highlighting to work the way you would think it should.</description>

      <description>Now on Hugo I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking lately to move off my shared hosting (I know, right?) and I have been seeking an excuse to move all my stuff over to Digital Ocean. I&amp;rsquo;ve finally gotten off the pot, and decided that I would expore Docker using Digital Ocean as the backing hardware.
Previously, I had a homegrown site. As I don&amp;rsquo;t spend my freetime making hot designs anymore, that site quickly fell out of anything resembling something polished.</description>
